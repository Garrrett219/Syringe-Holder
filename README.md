# Syringe Holder for Light Imaging

This device mounts a sample into a capillary, which then mounts the capillary in the dedicated plug insert and
in placed into the motor insert and then the sample is pushed out to be 3-D imaged.  

There are four different inserts that can be used with this deice, which allow different samples to be imaged. The four inserts will be interchangeable with the platform. 

The goal of this post is to properly show how to mount the platform and install the device properly.

##Folder Instructions
* Device Pictures includes images of the motor device as well as our additional device which is being inserted.
* Fusion-Cad Files includes all of the fusion 360 files used during this project.
* Protocol Process includes a video animation of how our device is properly inserted into the motor. I reccomend starting here to better understand the process.
