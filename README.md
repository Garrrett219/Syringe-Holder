# Syringe Holder for Light Imaging

This device mounts a sample into a capillary (pump it in an agarose mix) then mounting the capillary in the dedicated plug insert and mounting
in the motor insert and then push the sample out (the capillary works like a syringe with a plunger inside the glass tube) to image the sample. 

There are four different inserts that can be used with this deice, which allow different samples to be imaged. The four inserts will be interchangeable with the platform. 

The goal of this post is to properly show how to mount the platform and install the device properly.
